- **Buyer value-seeking behavior** in unfavorable market conditions

This analysis provides critical insights for real estate professionals to:
- Set competitive listing prices
- Maximize seller profitability
- Attract value-conscious buyers
- Balance market dynamics effectively

### Analytics Objective
**What effect do the most important features of a house have on its selling price?**

Our dual-focused approach targets:
1. **Predictive Accuracy**: Maximum model performance and reliability
2. **Business Interpretation**: Clear, actionable insights for stakeholders

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics Summary

| Variable | Median | Mean | Std Dev | Distribution |
|----------|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| **Price** | $450,000 | $540,084 | $367,135 | Right-skewed |
| **Bedrooms** | 3 | 3.369 | 0.93 | Right-skewed |

| **Sqft_Living** | 1,910 | 2,080 | 918.44 | Right-skewed |

### Key Correlation Insights

**Strongest Price Correlations:**
- **Living Space** (0.70): Strongest predictor
- **Bathrooms** (0.53): Moderate positive correlation

## ü§ñ Modeling Methodology

### Model Selection Strategy

We implemented a comprehensive modeling approach with **10 different models** across three methodological frameworks:

#### 1. **Linear Models (OLS/WLS)**
- **Challenge**: Initial model violated normality (EN) and homoscedasticity (EV) assumptions
- **Solution**: Log-linear transformation corrected normality
- **Limitation**: Heteroscedasticity persisted despite weighted least squares attempts

#### 2. **Regularized Regression (LASSO)**
- **Advantage**: Less sensitive to assumption violations
- **Feature Selection**: Automatic shrinkage to identify most important variables
- **Variants**: Both weighted and unweighted versions

#### 3. **Non-Parametric (Random Forest)**
- **Benefit**: No parametric assumptions required
- **Strength**: Handles non-linear relationships and interactions
- **Output**: Variable importance rankings

### Model Specifications

| Model Family | Variants | Predictors | Response Variable |
|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **OLS/WLS** | Full, Small | 11, 9 | log(price) |
| **LASSO** | Full, Small, Weighted | 11, 9 | log(price) |
| **Random Forest** | Full, Small | 11, 9 | log(price) |

**Feature Sets:**
- **Full Models** (11 predictors): All selected business-relevant features
- **Small Models** (9 predictors): Stepwise-selected significant features

---

## üí° Business Insights & Recommendations

### Strategic Findings

#### Primary Value Drivers
1. **Property Age**: Most influential factor (unexpected positive correlation)
2. **Lot Size**: Total property size matters more than just living space
3. **Quality Ratings**: Grade and condition have exponential impact on high-end properties
4. **Waterfront Access**: Commands significant premium (31.5%)
5. **Bathroom Count**: Each additional bathroom adds substantial value (8.4%)

#### Counterintuitive Discoveries
- **House Age Positive Effect**: Older homes command higher prices (0.6% per year)
- **Bedroom Quantity Penalty**: Additional bedrooms reduce price (-3.3% each)
- **Efficiency Over Size**: Quality and functionality trump raw bedroom count

### Actionable Recommendations

#### For Real Estate Professionals
- **Pricing Strategy**: Emphasize property age, lot size, and quality grade as primary factors
- **Marketing Focus**: Highlight waterfront access, view quality, and bathroom count
- **Value Enhancement**: Prioritize grade and condition improvements over bedroom additions
- **Competitive Analysis**: Use Random Forest model for accurate price predictions

#### For Property Sellers
- **Investment Priorities**: Focus on bathroom additions and condition improvements
- **Marketing Emphasis**: Showcase scenic views and waterfront access
- **Realistic Expectations**: Understand that property age and lot size are fixed advantages
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Emphasize craftsmanship and condition over bedroom count
